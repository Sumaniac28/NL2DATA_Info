## ‚ú® Overview

In today's data-driven world, the ability to quickly and easily extract insights from databases is crucial. However, the complexity of SQL often creates a barrier for non-technical users. NL2Data is a revolutionary full-stack application designed to democratize data analysis. It provides a seamless interface where users can connect to their PostgreSQL databases, ask questions in plain English, and receive beautiful, interactive visualizations in return. Whether you're a business analyst, a product manager, or a student, NL2Data empowers you to unlock the stories hidden within your data, no SQL knowledge required.

# NL2DATA: Installation & Configuration Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up the client and server for the NL2Data application. Since the client and server are in separate repositories, you will need to clone and configure each one individually.

---

## 1. Server Setup

First, let's set up the backend server.

#### a. Clone the server repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumaniac28/NL2DATA_SERVER.git
cd NL2DATA_SERVER
```

#### b. Install server dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### c. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the `NL2DATA_SERVER` directory and add your specific configurations.

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=your_db_port
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
TEST_DB_HOST=your_test_db_host
TEST_DB_PORT=your_test_db_port
TEST_DB_USERNAME=your_test_db_username
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=your_test_db_password
TEST_DB_DATABASE=your_test_db_name
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key_for_encryption
SECRET_KEY_ONE=a_long_and_random_secret_key
SECRET_KEY_TWO=another_long_and_random_secret_key
REACT_URL=http://localhost:3000
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_for_access_tokens
DB_SSL=false
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_anthropic_claude_api_key
```

#### d. Run database migrations:
This command will set up the necessary database tables.
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

---

## 2. Client Setup

Now, let's set up the frontend client in a **separate terminal window or directory**.

#### a. Clone the client repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumaniac28/NL2DATA-CLIENT.git
cd NL2DATA-CLIENT
```

#### b. Install client dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### c. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the `NL2DATA-CLIENT` directory. This tells the client where to send API requests.

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/graphql
```

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Use

To run the application, you need to start both the backend server and the frontend client.

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    In your `NL2DATA_SERVER` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend client:**
    In your `NL2DATA-CLIENT` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once both are running, you can access the application at the URL provided by the client's development server (usually `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address).
